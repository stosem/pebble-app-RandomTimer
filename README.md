Countdown timer with random interval.
Useful for board or party games (like hot potato) with reaction. Also may used in some other practice where you need a countdown that will expire after a randomized amount of time and without the knowing how much time is remaining.
RandomTimer can also wakeup automaticaly, so you don't need to keep app running, you may close it after start.

- Minimum and Maximum time values, that will be used when randomly picking a starting and ending time.
- Vibration pattern ( once or solid ).
- Auto repeat (relaunch timer) after time remaining.
